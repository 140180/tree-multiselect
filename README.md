## jQuery Tree Multiselect

**This plugin allows you to replace a `select` element and replace it with a nice sortable, treeview element.**
Note: this plugin assumes you have jQuery and jQuery UI.

### Installation
Put `jquery.tree-multiselect.js` and use it on your web page. The css file is optional and provides only a suggesstion of what I envisioned this plugin to be.

### License
This is MIT licensed. Do as you wish :)
